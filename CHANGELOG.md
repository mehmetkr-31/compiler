## [Unreleased]

### Compiler and `midenc`

- The compiler benchmark workflow now executes contract examples through deterministic MockChain
  scenarios, reports transaction cycle deltas against `next`, and retains replay snapshots and
  cycle-weighted flamegraphs alongside package-size artifacts.
- The filesystem package cache is now per-build. When the calling process already exported
  `MIDENC_PACKAGE_CACHE`, the compiler adopts that directory as its package cache and leaves
  it in place — the caller owns its location and lifetime, which is how packages stay
  readable after the compiler exits. Otherwise the compiler creates a globally unique lease
  directory under the configured target directory (`<target-dir>/packages`, by default the
  project's `target/miden/packages/`), exchanges dependency packages with
  its nested builds through it, and deletes it when the compilation ends. A directory that is
  never shared between builds cannot go stale, so the fingerprint derivation, permanent lock
  files, and stale-cache pruning of the earlier design are removed. A killed build can leave
  a remnant lease behind; remnants are inert and `cargo clean` removes them #1302
- The compiler records its dependency resolution in the package cache: for every Rust project
  it builds, a `miden-deps/<consumer>.deps.toml` maps each declared dependency — registry-resolved
  components included — to the artifact the resolver selected, with a flag naming whether it
  embeds component WIT so the macros can skip link-only packages without deserializing them.
  The root consumer's versioned `miden-deps/build-inputs` record distinguishes dependency
  inputs the frontends can enumerate completely from opaque provenance. Local non-Rust source
  trees and preassembled artifacts can use selective Cargo change directives when the launcher
  and Miden workspace boundary are also explicit; Rust/Cargo source builds, PATH-resolved
  launchers, and undiscovered workspace boundaries remain opaque and are re-staged on every
  relevant Cargo invocation rather than trusting an incomplete dep-info snapshot. The SDK macros
  and the contract build script consume these records instead of re-deriving resolution #1328
- `--stop-after=dependencies` stops a manifest-backed build after every dependency is
  resolved, assembled, and published into the package cache together with the recorded
  resolution — before the consumer project itself is compiled #1328
- Package-cache leases and the compiled artifacts of nested builds are created under the
  session's configured target directory (`--target-dir`/`MIDENC_TARGET_DIR`), so building from
  a read-only checkout works with a writable target directory; the default location is
  unchanged #1328
- Nested cargo builds now treat a present-but-empty `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` the way cargo
  does — as authoritative suppression of `RUSTFLAGS` — instead of falling back to the plain
  variable. The standalone-file route (`midenc` on a `.rs` file or stdin) composes its rustflags
  through the same helper, so an inherited encoded value can no longer delete the mandatory
  Miden flags there, and both routes share one mandatory-flag list #1328

### `cargo-miden`

- Contract templates and the repository examples now include a thin `build.rs` that calls the
  new `miden-sdk-build-script-support` crate to populate the package cache for builds `midenc`
  does not drive. Keeping the staging protocol in this SDK-versioned crate avoids exposing and
  duplicating compiler/proc-macro infrastructure across every generated project. Outside a
  midenc-driven build it stages package-cache generations under its `OUT_DIR`, fills a private
  generation with a nested
  `cargo miden build --release` that adopts it through `MIDENC_PACKAGE_CACHE`, and exports
  the same variable to macro expansion. Plain `cargo check` and IDE analysis now resolve
  dependency packages instead of reporting missing packages (#1215). Only a fully successful
  nested build publishes an immutable content-addressed generation, and changed generations
  remain under `OUT_DIR` for older IDE readers until `cargo clean`; byte-identical staging reuses
  the existing generation. A staging failure fails the outer build rather than exporting stale
  packages. Complete compiler-recorded inputs are watched selectively, while opaque provenance
  deliberately re-stages on every relevant Cargo invocation; a build-input record the script
  cannot read — missing, or written to a schema it does not know — is treated as opaque with a
  `cargo:warning`, so a compiler and a build-script crate at different versions degrade to
  always-re-stage instead of failing the build. Staging runs
  `cargo miden build --release --stop-after=dependencies`, so the crate itself is never compiled
  twice and its cargo
  feature selection does not affect staging; the nested build's target directories live
  under the script's `OUT_DIR`, honoring the outer build's configured target directory. The
  helper uses `cargo miden` from `PATH`, or the binary named by the `CARGO_MIDEN`
  environment variable #1298
- Fixed the contract templates' `miden-project.toml` manifests, which were missing the
  `[lib].path` key the VM v0.25 project model requires; projects generated from the templates
  failed both `cargo miden build` and macro expansion with "unable to parse project manifest:
  missing field `path`"

### Rust SDK

- The FPI macro diagnostic for a dependency package missing from a midenc-driven build now names
  the searched `MIDENC_PACKAGE_CACHE` directory and the expected package file names, instead of
  an empty candidate list and a `target/miden/<profile>` hint that the cache lookup never
  consults #1302
- FPI expansions record `option_env!("MIDENC_PACKAGE_CACHE")`, so a consumer crate recompiles —
  and re-reads its dependency procedure roots — whenever the package-cache path changes. Every
  `cargo miden build` uses a fresh per-build directory, so a midenc-driven build always
  re-expands its consumers; builds against a stable exported directory re-expand only when
  package contents change #1302
- BREAKING: The component WIT generated by `#[component]` is now embedded in the compiled Miden
  package (a `wit` section of the `.masp`) instead of being written to `target/generated-wit/`,
  and the SDK macros read dependency WIT from the dependency's compiled package. The
  `wit = "..."` keys in `miden-project.toml` are now only a fallback for dependency packages
  without embedded WIT (e.g. produced by other toolchains): setting the key for a package that
  embeds WIT is an error, and a package built by an older Miden toolchain is skipped unless the
  key supplies its WIT — only a macro that references it reports the missing interface. See the [migration guide](./sdk/sdk/MIGRATION.md) for the manifest
  edits and rebuild steps #1248
- BREAKING: The SDK macros now read dependency packages only from the `MIDENC_PACKAGE_CACHE`
  directory (or from a manifest path that names a `.masp` file directly). The previous search
  of `target/miden/<profile>` output directories — the dependency's own, surrounding
  workspaces', and ambient (`CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, `OUT_DIR`, working-directory) targets — was
  removed, along with its freshest-first selection and macro-side package id and version
  checks; the cache is unique to each build and its contents are trusted.
  Builds driven by `cargo miden build` export the variable already; plain `cargo build`,
  `cargo check`, and IDE analysis need the contract `build.rs`. An expansion without a
  configured cache now fails with instructions instead of searching the filesystem #1298
- The SDK macros resolve dependencies through the artifact map the compiler writes into the
  package cache, so workspace, workspace-path, git, and registry dependencies now resolve
  during macro expansion exactly as the compiler resolved them. Entries the compiler records
  as embedding no component WIT — the base link libraries, MASM-only dependencies — are
  skipped without deserializing their packages. The name-probing of `.masp` files remains
  only as a fallback for hand-assembled caches without a map #1328
- A dependency whose package embeds no component WIT (and has no `wit` key) — for example a
  link-only MASM library — no longer fails every macro expansion; it is skipped, and only a
  macro that actually references it reports the missing WIT, at the reference site #1328

## [0.10.0-rc.1]

### Compiler and `midenc`

- `midenc` accepts `--stop-after=CHECKPOINT` (or `MIDENC_STOP_AFTER`) to stop at a frontend's
  `parse`, `analyze`, `transform`, `lower`, or `assemble` checkpoint, or at a fully qualified
  checkpoint such as `hir.initial`. Invalid checkpoints report the names available for the
  selected input, and combining `--stop-after` with a legacy `-C*-only` stop flag is an error.
- Running `midenc` without an input path now compiles `miden-project.toml` from the current
  directory.
- Manifest-backed Rust projects now use the same checkpoint pipeline as standalone Rust, Wasm,
  HIR, and MASM inputs. Requested `--emit` artifacts are written instead of being silently
  discarded, including intermediate WAT, HIR, and MASM output.
- Fixed target isolation for Rust packages that declare both library and executable targets, so
  one target can no longer reuse another target's compiled output, read-only data, or account
  metadata.
- Fixed compilation of standalone HIR worlds and single-module worlds with no component. Top-level
  supporting modules that contain functions but no globals or data segments are now lowered and
  linked, and bodyless functions produce an input diagnostic instead of panicking.
- Ambiguous executable selection, unknown `--target` values, and unsupported kernel targets are
  now rejected consistently before Cargo runs, with diagnostics specific to the selected project.
- Fixed stdin file-type detection for Rust, `builtin.*` HIR, and additional MASM forms including
  `namespace`, `extern package`, and `begin`.
- Fixed nondeterministic HIR common-subexpression elimination that could make identical input
  produce different MASM, MAST digests, or package bytes depending on allocation order #1257
- Naturally aligned four-byte Wasm scalar loads and stores now lower directly through Miden
  element-space memory operations, reducing address-normalization overhead while preserving traps
  for accesses that violate their declared alignment.
- Account-procedure and transaction-script export metadata is now preserved through Wasm lowering,
  allowing protocol 0.16 tooling to construct account interfaces and locate transaction-script
  entrypoints.
- Assembled packages now preserve source provenance.

### `cargo-miden`

- Cargo-backed Miden builds now publish compiled dependency packages to the shared
  `<project>/target/miden/packages` cache and expose that cache to nested builds, allowing SDK FPI
  macros to resolve matching dependency packages during a normal build.
- Added the public `cargo_miden::bundle` API for accessing the embedded project scaffold and Rust
  templates and their SHA-256 digest, extracting the bundle, and locating a selected template. The
  embedded full-project scaffold includes its Claude Code settings, contract-build hook, and Miden
  SDK skills.

### `miden-objtool`

- `miden-objtool dump debug-info` now displays VM v0.25 package debug information, including the
  unified string, type, function, source-file, source-node, variable, inline-call, and location
  data.

### Libraries and public APIs

- Added the frontend-neutral `midenc_compile::pipeline` API. Custom frontends can register input
  extensions, checkpoint routes, stop aliases, and artifact renderers; callers can observe
  checkpoint artifacts, stop at a named checkpoint, or resume from an existing artifact with
  `Start::At`.
- Added the HIR `ValueEquivalence` strategy trait and matching identity, type-only, and
  ignore-value hasher/equivalence pairs for analyses that key operations by operands.
- Public `MidenComponent` and `CodegenOutput` artifacts now retain source provenance, exposed by
  `CodegenOutput::source_provenance()`. `LinkLibrary::tx_kernel()` provides the separate protocol
  0.16 transaction-kernel package.
- MASM file disassembly now reads the complete module tree rooted at the selected file, rather than
  lifting only that file's module, and project disassembly resolves dependencies through the VM
  v0.25 package model.

### Migration and breaking changes

- The compiler stack now targets Miden VM v0.25 and the protocol 0.16 transaction-kernel API.
  Update matching `miden-*` dependencies and rebuild `.masp` packages for the new package and debug
  information model. SDK projects must also mark callable component methods with
  `#[account_procedure]` and apply the protocol binding changes in the SDK's
  [changelog](sdk/CHANGELOG.md) and [migration guide](sdk/sdk/MIGRATION.md).
- `--release` now selects the release assembler profile; it previously assembled with the `dev`
  profile. Manifest-backed Rust roots and Rust dependencies compiled from source in release builds
  now derive Cargo's `profile.release.opt-level` from `--optimize`: `basic` uses `1`, `max` uses
  `3`, `size` uses `s`, `size-min` uses `z`, and `none` or `balanced` uses `2`. Update size,
  cycle-count, digest, and package-byte baselines where these settings change generated artifacts.
- Compiled dependency packages moved from each dependency's profile-specific target directory to
  `<project>/target/miden/packages`. Update scripts that read the previous paths directly; nested
  builds receive the new location through `MIDENC_PACKAGE_CACHE`.
- Note and transaction-script packages now embed the transaction-kernel package when it is not
  already present. This changes package dependencies, bytes, and digests; update artifact baselines
  and package-dependency inspection accordingly.
- `midenc-compile` removed the public `Stage` trait and `stages` module, along with
  `compile_to_memory_with_pre_assembly_stage`, `compile_to_optimized_hir`,
  `compile_to_unoptimized_hir`, and `compile_link_output_to_masm`. Use `pipeline::Pipeline`,
  `CompilationRequest`, checkpoint observers, and `Start::At`; `compile_to_memory` now returns
  `CompiledArtifact`. `Options` struct literals must also initialize `stop_after`, normally to
  `None`.
- `compile_link_output_to_masm_with_pre_assembly_stage` now takes an owned `'static` callback of
  type `FnMut(&pipeline::backend::LoweredTarget) -> CompilerResult<()>`. The callback may observe
  lowered output or fail the build, but it can no longer replace `CodegenOutput`.
- `midenc_session::Session` no longer owns or exposes a loaded `project`, and
  `Session::new_project` no longer accepts one. Use `pipeline::prepare_project` and
  `PreparedProject` when project access is required.
- `midenc_frontend_masm::disassemble_project_target` was replaced by
  `disassemble_project_target_with_sources`, which accepts `ProjectSourceInputs` and a
  `ProjectDependencyGraph`; `disassemble_module` now takes ownership of `Box<Module>`. Prefer
  `ProjectTargetInput::new` and `ExternalMetadata::default` over struct literals, which must now
  account for package and kernel inputs. MASM disassembly now rejects recursive call graphs; remove
  recursion before disassembling those procedures.
- `Session`, `DiagnosticsHandler`, and `Context::source_manager()` now expose
  `Arc<dyn SourceManager>` without a `Send + Sync` promise. Code that needs to send the source
  manager between threads must retain an appropriately typed handle itself.
- `MasmComponent` no longer has a `kernel` field or the `assemble` and `assemble_with_registry`
  methods. Use `source_inputs(target, session)` with the VM project assembler, or use the
  high-level compilation pipeline so metadata, read-only data, provenance, and kernel embedding
  are retained. Direct `MidenComponent` and `CodegenOutput` struct literals must initialize the
  new `source_provenance` field.
- Compiler events moved from raw trace codes to VM v0.25 event IDs: replace `TraceEvent` with
  `Event`, `TRACE_FRAME_START`/`TRACE_FRAME_END`/`TRACE_PRINT_LN` with
  `FRAME_START_EVENT`/`FRAME_END_EVENT`/`PRINT_LN_EVENT`, and `as_u32()` with `as_event_id()`.
  `Unknown` now contains `EventId`, and `AssertionFailed` was removed in favor of VM/core-library
  event handlers.
- Compiler intrinsics are now one preassembled package. Replace
  `intrinsics::load(name, source_manager)` and the removed intrinsic-module-name constants with
  `intrinsics::load()`, then link the returned package statically. `midenc_session::STDLIB` and
  `CompiledLibrary` were removed; use `CoreLibrary::default().package()` when the core package is
  needed. `LinkLibrary::load` now returns `Arc<Package>`, and the
  `midenc_codegen_masm::masm::{Library, KernelLibrary}` re-exports were removed in favor of the
  VM v0.25 package and project types.
- HIR value-equivalence strategies now decide type compatibility as well as identity. Replace
  `exact_value_match` with `DefaultValueEquivalence`; replace `ignore_value_equivalence` with
  `ValueTypeEquivalence` to retain its previous type-checking behavior. Use
  `IgnoreValueEquivalence` only when value identity and type should both be ignored, and add an
  explicit type comparison to custom closures that relied on the old implicit check.
- `miden-objtool decorators` and the public `miden_objtool::decorators` module were removed without
  replacement. The textual `dump debug-info` format changed to the v0.25 source-node model, and
  exhaustive matches on `DumpError` must handle the new `InvalidDebugInfo` variant.
